# Guitar Pedal Effects on FPGA
This is my Bachelor's degree project. I have used a FPGA to modify audio signal and create different sounds, like distortion, overdrive, echo, reverb... Terasic DE1-SoC board was used for this project.

## The Demo
Here you can see the project in action!
Click in the image and you will be redirected to YouTube, where I hosted the video to show how does it work.

## Documentation
You can read the whole project documentation in this <a href="https://github.com/jagumiel/Guitar-Pedal-Effects-on-FPGA/blob/master/TFG-JA_Gumiel-Pedal_de_Efectos.pdf">PDF</a>.  If you just want to read a very short description, you can check the project on my blog, I wrote <a href="https://jagumiel.xyz/blog/2017/10/26/pedal-de-efectos-digital/">this entry</a>. Unfortunately, both are written in Spanish only, I will try to get some time to translate at least a quick read version.

## Fast run
Go to the folder FPGA-Stompbox/TFG_Stompbox and open the file testaudio_DE1SoC.qpf with Quartus software.
Modifying the file testaudio_DE1SoC.vhd you can choose the effect you want to use. It is also possible to combine them chaining them. In order to adjust the desired effect, you will need some potentiometers connected to the ADC.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but I still working on this readme.
